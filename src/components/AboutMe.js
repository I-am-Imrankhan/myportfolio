        , with several years of experience in both mobile app and web
        development. Recently, I developed a user authentication-based website
        similar to blocket.se, utilizing React and Firebase. I have an
        insatiable curiosity for learning new concepts in the programming world.
        Currently, I am seeking a position as a Flutter developer within a
        company that offers opportunities for growth and continuous learning. I
        pride myself on being a quick learner, possessing strong programming
        skills, a keen eye for design and UX, and the ability to work
        effectively in a team. I am committed to staying current with industry
        trends and continually expanding my skill set.
